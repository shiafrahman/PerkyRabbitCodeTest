Hello,

First,
1. Open the EmployeeCertificateManagement.API folder and open the EmployeeCertificateManagement.API.sln.
2. If you've already modified the DatabaseServer in the connection string in a previous Question, you can skip this step.
3. If you've previously executed the "Update-database" command, ignore it.
4. Simply launch the program.


Second,
1. Open the CertificateManagementClient folder and open the CertificateManagementClient.sln.
2. Start the program.
